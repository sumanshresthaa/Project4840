## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r}
library(foreign)
heart = read.arff("C:/Users/DESKTOP/Downloads/dataset_53_heart-statlog.arff")
head(heart)
```

```{r}
heart.new = heart[-14]
mydist = dist(heart.new)
result = hclust(mydist, method='ward.D2')
plot(result)
```

```{r}
result$height
```

```{r}
summary(heart)
```
